##Overview: The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict differential methlyation in preterm and term newborns based on a array of features. Publicly available methylation array data from the Gene Expression Omnibus will be used for this purpose. Quality control will be performed using standard approaches prior to feature selection, and subsequently a number of machine learning models will be tested. We hypothesize that appropriate feature selection and methods will lead to a useful predictive model that could be utilized for a variety of exposure-epigenetic relationships. 

##Introduction:  Epigenetics is a burgeoning field that is making a concerted effort to explain the mechanisms behind gene-environment interactions, the developmental origins of health and disease, cancer, and other phenomena [1-4]. Perinatal stressors have emerged as key exposures that impact later life outcomes, especially neurodevelopment, metabolic diseases, and obesity [5-7]. Conrad Waddington, a embryologist and developmental biologist, is creditied with coining the term "epigenetics" in 1942 [8]. The exact defition is contested, but generally refers to the elements that modify the expression of genes without changing the DNA sequence itself. As the genetic era began soon thereafter, new questions about differences in gene expression and phenotype development, the discovery of imprinted genes, and developments in sequencing and analysis methods paved the way for epigenetics research. More recently, epigenetic marks have been shown to be influenced by a number of perinatal exposures, including maternal behavior [3], famine [9], time spent in the neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU) [10], and preterm birth [11].

Unlike classical genetics and despite the wealth of studies in animal models and continuing work in birth cohorts and other human samples, epigenetic research has not yet made use of machine learning. In genetics, machine learning has been applied extensively as a tool for prediction, dimensionality reduction, and classification. It has provided information on population and individual risk, and has increased the accuracy of various predictions [12-14]. Implementing these methods using epigenetic research is a novel approach will require interdisciplinary input from data scientists, basic science researchers in genetics and epigenetics, clincians, evironmental health scientists, epidemiologists and others. This study will be the first of its kind to use machine learning in this context of prenatal exposures and epigenetics in a human sample.
